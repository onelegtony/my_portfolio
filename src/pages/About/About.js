          Hi! My name is Sasha, I am a developer based in Oslo, Norway.
          <br />I have rediscovered the world of programming {codingDays} days
          ago. I am currently on a path to a career change. At the moment I am
          working in service industry, but also had a taste of sales,
          photography and videography.
          <br />I am obsessed with technology, quality games and movies. If I am
          not working, I study, but when I donâ€™t, I get lost in magical worlds
          of fantasy.
          <br />I am always happy to have a chat, so feel free to send me a{' '}
